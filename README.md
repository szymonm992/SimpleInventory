# SimpleInventory

**Project controls:**
Player Movement: WSAD
Open inventory: Tab
Interact with object: E
Drop item from inventory: Right mouse button (when hovering an inventory slot)

Since player input uses action map input system, the controls can be modified by overriding InputActions asset, contained within Assets/Data/Settings/Inputs
Items database, items and recipes can be modified/extended either. You can find essential scriptable objects within Assets/Data/ScriptableObjects
